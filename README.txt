zopyx.tinymceplugins.imgmap
===========================

This module allows you to edit image maps inside the TinyMCE editor
in Plone 4.0 or higher.

The code is based on the ``imgmap`` plugin for TinyMCE.
See http://code.google.com/p/imgmap for details.

Installation
============
As with every Plone add-on: add ``zopyx.tinymceplugins.imgmap`` to the ``eggs``
option of your buildout configuration and re-run buildout.

Configuration
=============
Right now you have to ``map`` and ``area`` manually to the list of allowed
HTML tags inside the Plone control panel for HTML filtering.

Usage
=====
Inside TinyMCE you have to select an image inside the editor window and choose
the imagemap icon from the toolbar of TinyMCE.
